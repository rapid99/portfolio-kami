title: Challenges Learning To Become A Developer
---

If there's anything I've learned so far on my journey to becoming a professional software developer it is that there will always be many difficulties and challenges along the way. A lot of times, I have found myself frustrated with the feeling of "I am not capable of doing this". With so many languages with so many different features, it has felt like an impossible skill to grasp and master. 

One thing that Bloc has always told me that programming is such a vast concept that no one will be able to know everything about it. Using Google and asking for help in a vareity of different methods is a normal practice. No one expects you to know everything since it's virtually impossible; there's just too much to know.

Keeping a cool head, talking through the issue at hand and going over each line of code and knowing what it's doing are key concepts to overcoming issues while programming. I have been remembering these concepts as challenges get more difficult and more abstract.
