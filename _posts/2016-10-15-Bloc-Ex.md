title: My Experience With Bloc
---

My experience with Bloc thus far has been a great one. 

The structure of learning that the part time web development program has been effective with me. It provides a hands on approach that initally walks you through the code step-by-step. However towards the end of projects, Bloc asks for something and it's up to you to come up with a solution. I have found these later parts very rewarding as it has felt very satisfying to create solutions to problems on your own and be able to see the results. 

At this point in the Bloc curriculum, I have completed the front-end section and am transitioning into the back-end portion. During this transitionary period, I am create this Jekyll based portfolio while also starting to learn about Javascript front end framework, Angular.js. 

I am excited for what the future holds regarding my education with Bloc. Here's to many more weeks of knowledge and success!
