title: My Path To Becoming A Developer
---

When I first began my career in IT, I was working at a startup company in Tucson, Arizona called Mural Consulting. I was a business software consultant who was basically walking customers through a vareity of different services our company had to offer. This included a template driven piece of software that allowed the user to make their own websites (think Wordpress but A LOT simpler). While I showed my users this software every single day, I began to wonder about the underlying workings of this software that allowed my users to have such an easy time building a website. These thoughts lead to my initial interest in development. 

In college, I took a HTML / CSS class that was my first true exposure to programming. 
>I absolutly LOVED the class and excelled in it; easily obtaining an A at the end of the semester. Unfortunetly, I never persued this feeling at the time and instead of diving deeper into it, I kept on my inital pace of graduating with a major in Economics. 

However, the joy and wonders of programming lay dormant inside of me and began to peek out once I graduated college and moved to Denver, CO. 

In Denver, I obtained a job at one of Denver's largest hospitals, Denver Health, as a Help Desk technician. I quickly climbed through the ranks at the Help Desk, largely due to my competency with computers and technology in general. Within 2 years, I became the first ever "Help Desk Tier 3" technician which allowed me to expand my time into Networking, Security, Telecommunications and Desktop support in addtion to basic Help Desk tasks. This helped me gain a fuller appreciation of what the IT world was like outside of basic support. This was a large motivator for pushing even harder to break out of this entry-level position and continue to persue a higher level of learning while on the job. 

After obtaining numerous certifications (CompTIA A+, Network + and Security +), and helping with the implentaion of ReadyOP, a mass communication application the hospital has just purchased, I felt my time at the Help Desk was nearing an end. I spied an open position as an Application Analyst within Denver Health and inquired. Thanks to my rapid rise at the Help Desk and my role with ReadyOP, I was hired for the analyst job after only a 15 minute interview. 

As a new analyst, I was taught the inner workings of a few different applications around the hospital as well as supporting ReadyOP (which by this time had completly become my responsibility). 

>Life was good, but not great. I still wanted more. This was a step up, but still not where I wanted to be.

Months went by and so did many months of dispair while trying to learn how to program on my own. My focus was never really there while trying to learn this way since they weren't deadlines, assignments or really any help. It felt more like a half-assed hobby rather than an attempt to alter my carreer path. Eventually, after much consideration, I enrolled in the part time web development program with Bloc in order to persue my quickly growing passion of programming. 

Currently, I sit here and write this blog post after having spent 7 weeks with Bloc. At this point, things are really starting to click and languages feel much more natural. HTML and CSS are appearing on my screen out of muscle memory and Javascript is starting to become the same. Every day with Bloc, I seem to gain more knowledge and better understand concepts I couldn't grasp previously. 

As far as work, I am now using Javascript to customize Microsoft Dynamic CRM and do numerous projects with Denver Health's development team. 

I am satisfied with my progress so far but I know I have to stay hungry for success. 

>This is only the beginning. Success is not something that is owned, it is leased, and rent is due every.single.day.
