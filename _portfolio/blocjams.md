## Explanation

Bloc Jams is a Spotify-esqe music player that is the initial project I undertook while I was a student at Bloc. It acted as an introductory look at utilizing Javscript, DOM scripting and jQuery while reinforcing sound HTML 5 and CSS 3 solutions.

## Problem

For my introductory project at Bloc, I was presented with the challenge of building a 3 screen web application that can actually play music. Additionally, it needed to be adaptable to how ever many albums are added to the collection.

## Solution

Javascript, DOM scripting and jQuery will be utilized to power the music player. HTML and CSS should be able to handle the rest of the webpages.  

## Results

Using HTML5, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, I was able to create a landing page, an album collection page and a music player page. 

The landing page features a logo, a collections link, a large photo and a few selling points on the bottom of the page that only appear when the user scrolls down far enough to see them. It also features some transition effects via CSS to add some additional colors and features. 

The album colleciton page is configurable to be able to add as many albums as we want on to the page. We would just need to add an additional object and increase the count of how many albums should show. The color scheme matches that of the landing page. 

The music player is the star of the show. It features the ability to play and pause songs via clicking on the number to the left of the song. The icon of the number will change to reflect this. Additionally, there is a player bar on the bottom of the page that has a play/pause button, volume control, seek control and shows the name of the song and artist.  

## Conclusion

Overall, this was a nice introductory application for using Javascript, jQuery and DOM scriping together with basic HTML and CSS. It greatly helped me gain comfortablilty using Javascript and boosted by confidence when I was able to successfully implement trickier features such as the ability to play music.
